# Joel-Savings-App

This **savings app** was created specifically to help me manage my finances when I got too lazy to calculate my own savings manually. Built in **Python**, this app tracks deposits, calculates spending, and provides an overview of past transactions. It also sends an email notification after each successful deposit.

The app is designed to be extendable, allowing for integration with other systems and easy future improvements.

## Features

- **Add Deposit**: Input your deposit amount, and it will be added to your savings.
- **Spending Calculation**: Automatically calculates your total spending based on your transactions.
- **View Past Records**: Easily access all past deposits and spending records in a clean format.
- **Email Notifications**: Receive a confirmation email every time you save, providing a summary of your deposit.

## Usage

1. **Add Deposit**: 
   - Navigate to the "Add Deposit" section of the app.
   - Input the amount youâ€™d like to save, and the system will update your balance.
   
2. **View Spending**:
   - Head to the "Spending Summary" page to get an automatic calculation of your total spending.

3. **View Records**:
   - Use the "Records" feature to see a detailed history of all your transactions (deposits and spending).

4. **Email Notification**:
   - After each successful deposit, an email will be sent to your registered address with the details of the transaction.

## Development and Integration

- **Built in Python**: The core logic of this app is implemented in Python, making it lightweight and easy to modify.
